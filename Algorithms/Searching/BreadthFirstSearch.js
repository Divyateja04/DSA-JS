//We keep going left to right level by level in this type of search
//We go level by level vertically
//1. first level
//2. second level and so on
//    9 
//   4 20
//  1 6 15 170
//Search order [9, 4, 20, 1, 6, 15, 170]

//Pros:
//Time Complexity of BFS and DFS is same
//Good for finding Shortest Path since we search closest nodes first

//Cons:
//More memory
