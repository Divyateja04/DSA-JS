//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:BFS/BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: DFS/BFS(DFS will take time if its deep)

//If the tree is very wide: DFS/DFS

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS

//Finding the shortest path: BFS

//In graphs, BFS is used to find closest nodes while DFS is used to find longest paths
//DFS use backtracking

//We use dijkstra(can't accomadate -ve weights) and bell fordmanO(n^2) for shortest paths especially if we have weights
