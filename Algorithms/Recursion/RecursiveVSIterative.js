//Anything you can do with a recursion CAN be done iteratively(loops)

//1. Recursion:
//Pros- 
//DRY
//Readability
//Cons-
//Large Stack

//Use recursion when we don't know how many loops to go through or with datastructures where we don't know how deep it is

//For search recursion is preferred

//Every time we are using a tree or converting something into a tree, follow recursion
//1. Divide into a number of sub problems that are smaller instances of the same problem
//2. Each instance of the sub problem identical in nature
//3. The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand

//Divide and Conquer using Recursion
