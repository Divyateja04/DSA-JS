//When to use what?
//Insertion is used when we have small amounts of data or if items are mostly sorted
//Really fast

//Bubble/Selection Sort
//Never gonna use it mostly

//Merge Sort
//Best for worst case scenarios
//Not best for space complexity

//QuickSort
//Not best for worst case scenarios
//Best for space complexity

//We can improve O(nlogn) by not using comparision and using something like radix sort and counting sort
//These are non comparision sorts
//Only work on numbers though
