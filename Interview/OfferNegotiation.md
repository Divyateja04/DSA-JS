## Handling Rejection
- Rejections aren't shown up on linkedin/experience/resumes or anything. It's probably good they rejected since you wouldn't have liked working for them anyway  
- Try to get feedback and when to reapply  
- Just don't take it personally

## Negotiation 101
- When someone asks what salary you want, just check stats depending and check.
- Don't end the conversation, just keep it standing
- All you say is average salary package
- Give Reason for everything
- Don't decline/accept, Say that this is a big salary decision and you plan on working long term so I would like to discuss with family
- Always negotiate
- Be Positive
- Have Stakes

```I just want to let you know and give you an update on my interviewing process. I've just received an offer from another company. You can give the company name, which is quite strong. With that said, I'm really excited to potentially be working with your company, I had a really good time interviewing with you and I really wanted to see if we can make things work, since my timeline is now a little bit compressed with this new offer. Is there anything we can do to make the process go a little bit faster?```

## Handling Multiple offers
1. Is there an offer that you feel you are underqualified for?(You should go for it!!)
2. Long term growth potential and don't look for immediate options
3. Will you respect people around you?
4. Salary and Benefits
5. Is your decision based on desperation

## Getting a Raise
