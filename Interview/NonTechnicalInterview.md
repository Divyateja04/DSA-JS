## My introduction
I'm Divyateja Pasupuleti, a student of BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. I started off my coding journey at an age of 11 where I wrote my first code in QBasic and Visual Studio, atleast the one that was available back then.  

Then I found my interest and creativity leaning towards web development and started working on HTML, CSS and JS. Even though I had to give a gap to that due to entrance exam prep, I recovered pretty fast and got myself updated on the latest technologies and frameworks like ReactJS and some APIs.

I made many projects using ReactJS, HTML/CSS and JS. I even learnt Datastructures and Algorithms at an age of 17 in Javascript and implemented most of the datastructures on my own.  

I'm really proud to say that I built my first actual project in my 10th grade, it was a device that can save people from drowning in the ocean and was made using python and recieved accolades from many national level exhibitions

## Why us?
- Show you want to grow
- Demonstrate why you are the best  

Key here is to make the interviewer feel special and make them feel as if that's your first choice and that we really like that company and respect the fact that they work there  

Just don't repeat a pretty used answer such as, I saw you on linkedin and wanted money or something  like that. Better answer is that   

I've researched your company for a while and have seen immense growth in these fields and heard you were working on a X project and I am interested in working there and think I have the necessary knowledge to work there

Speak to current employees and find out more details about the company and projects 

If they ask why we left a previous job, just don't be negative or complain about it, maybe say you want to grow

## Tell me about a problem you've solved
- Have this prepared
- Have metrics and numbers
- Scaling, Performance and Security
- Show how you are different
- Relate it to the job

_Situation - Action - Result_ Method: 
- Problem
- What we did
- How did it change after that

## What is your biggest Weakness?
(Don't tell stuff like I care too much or I work too hard)
- Real answer
- Show how you improved it

## Any Questions for me?
- Focus on them not company
- Mention something they mentioned
1. What is a mistake that you did in the first month you joined here and how did it effect you?
2. Where do you think this company will be in like 2-3 years
3. Why did you join this company?
4. What do you wish you were told before joining here?

----------------------------------
I'm sure you have lots of candidates to see.
But I want to say one last thing.
There are no shortages of developers for you to interview.
However, there is a shortage of good, talented, egoless developers with ambition to learn.
It's not the ones that are unable to admit that they're wrong.

The best developers aren't the ones that know the language inside and out at the expense of having blinders.
It is not the ones who are unable to admit they are wrong.

I'm not the most experienced developer that you may interview today, but the one thing that you can guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview that will work as hard to develop his or her skill every day, play nicely with all the other developers at the company, and isn't so narrow minded and Problem-Solving that he or she isn't willing to try new and novel ideas.

When you hire me, you will rest assured that you won't have to micromanage me.
You don't have to extinguish fires.
And in one year I'll be one of your most valuable employees. I can guarantee that I'm at a point in my career where I want to be surrounded by a team that I can grow with and be surrounded by smart people like yourself.

And I've chosen this company specific for that reason. And you've probably had similar experiences in your career where one company allows you to really have an impact and propel your career.

I'm at the stage now and I hope to be part of the team with you. So thank you for your time and I hope to hear back soon from you.
All right. That was it.
