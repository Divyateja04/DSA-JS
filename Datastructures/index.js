//Datastructures is a collection of values basically a storage place for your files but each specializes in it's own thing and based on the scenario we choose the datastructures
//Generally variables are stored in RAM while storage is used for storing actual files
//A 8 bit can store 2^8-1=255, 16bit can store 2^16-1
//A 32 bit and 64 bit store 2^32-1 and 2^64-1 respectively and similarly each datastructure has similar limits
